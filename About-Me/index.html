            <h1 class="title">Art & Culture</h1>
            <p>
                As a young child I would find an interest in art and drawing. This interest wasn't really applicable
                because I was not
                very good at actually using the tools to make a physical piece. I knew the <strong
                    class="blue">fundamentals</strong> of art and what
                made something
                look pleasing, but I could not personally convey those themes. I always have loved music as well, but as
                with art I was
                never very good at putting my <strong class="blue">creative knowledge</strong> into
                practice.
                <br>
                <br>
                <img class="float-right" src="/assets/icons/palette.svg">
                As I grew older I started taking classes on art and design; learning the <strong
                    class="blue">psychology</strong> of color, font,
                composition, etc.
                This knowledge would push me further through my experience with <strong class="blue">graphic
                    design</strong>, and as a result I would
                start looking
                into everything that has to do with design. I then discovered website design, which shares the same
                <strong class="blue">principles</strong> that
                graphic design does, and I started making some drafts of my own. Some of these were very sloppy, but as
                time went on I
                learned the little details that make or break designs.
                <br>
                <br>
                This didn't last very long, as I wanted to actually be able to turn my designs into actual products that
                can be
                interacted with. So the next step was to learn how to <strong class="blue">code</strong>. It took me a
                while
                to really understand how
                coding works,
                but eventually I got the hang of it. Now I have been blessed enough to compete in a national Skills USA
                Web Design
                competition and have the ability to create products I had dreamed of years ago.

            <div>
                <h1 class="heading">Business & Entrepreneurship</h1>
                <p>
                    Along with the design classes, I have taken multiple courses on <strong
                        class="blue">marketing</strong>
                    and <strong class="blue">entrepreneurship</strong>.
                    These classes give me
                    the knowledge on brand identity, social media perception, marketing strategies, and many more things
                    that directly
                    impact a company's success.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This knowledge mixed with website creation will ensure that any client of mine will have their brand
                    has a <strong class="blue">professional</strong>
                    and <strong class="blue">polished reputation</strong>. I believe that brand consistency is very
                    important and is the reason you
                    can't just have a
                    cookie cutter website that uses a template to save time. Websites need to reflect the company's
                    <strong class="blue">goal</strong>
                    and <strong class="blue">purpose</strong>; all
                    while helping their customers use or learn about their product.

            <h1 class="title">Morals & Ethics</h1>
            <p>
                Many companies and big design firms will try their hardest to stay morally neutral and charge prices
                that don't
                reflect their work most of the time. I believe that every business has different <strong
                    class="blue">needs</strong> and <strong class="blue">expectations</strong>;
                so finding
                those out helps me determine what kind of project I will be getting into, and also helps the client
                understand exactly
                what they should expect as a result.
                <br>
                <br>
                This is my job, so I still need to profit; but at the end of the day my clients are paying for my
                <strong class="blue">knowledge</strong>. I offer
                simple solutions for small businesses and because of that I recognize the budget constraints or any
                other financial
                setbacks that need to be accounted for. I strive to offer a <strong class="blue">reasonable
                    price</strong>
                for my clients based on the
                amount of work
